# Nestor Workflow as a Graphical User Interface

Intended as a user-centric workflow, many of the associated tasks are better approached through a GUI. 
Nestor originally began as a prototype interface to a scikit-learn pipeline. 
It morphed a bit over time, as we realized that consistent iteration on existing annotations with feedback from the algorithms were crucial. 

There are several interfaces under development:

- [`nestor-qt`](https://github.com/usnistgov/nestor-qt): legacy desktop-oriented app 
  - most development and feature-complete
  - no longer actively developed (still maintained)
  
- [`nestor-web`](https://github.com/usnistgov/nestor-web)
  - modern interface built on Electron
  - fewer features; being actively developed
