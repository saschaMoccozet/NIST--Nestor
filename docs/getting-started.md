# Getting Started
To install `nestor`, utilize a python installation (preferrably an environment like `pyenv` or `conda`) to install from the Pypi repository:

```bash
pip install nist-nestor
```

The core `nestor` module is intended to assist analysts (and the UIs or pipelines the may create) in annotating technical text. If you just want to jump in to a more polished experience, head over to the [User Interfaces](gui-links.md) page.
